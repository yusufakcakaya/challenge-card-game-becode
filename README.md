‚ú¥Ô∏è The main mission of the game is creating a card game with OOP in python ü•á

‚ú¥Ô∏è It builds a basis for a card game.

‚ú¥Ô∏è At the end of game players are not getting a point.

‚ú¥Ô∏è The game was built just for a deck of cards to get created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no   cards left.

‚ú¥ So,
  - The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
  - The game generates all the cards.
  - The game distributes all the cards.

‚ùì For those that don't know, a deck of cards is composed of 52 cards. Each card has a symbol (one of `[‚ô•, ‚ô¶, ‚ô£, ‚ô†]`) and a value, ranging from `['A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K']`.
